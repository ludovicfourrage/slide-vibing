# Recommendations

## Structure of a Strong Recommendation

### The Complete Recommendation Statement

**[Action] + [Scope] + [Rationale] + [Expected Outcome]**

Example:
"We recommend **investing $5M** in **mobile app redesign** because **conversion rates lag competitors by 40%**, which will **recover an estimated $15M in annual revenue**."

## Building the Case

### 1. Frame the Decision
What question are we answering? What are the options?

"The Board must decide whether to: (A) Build internally, (B) Acquire capability, or (C) Partner with established player"

### 2. Establish Criteria
What factors matter for this decision? Weight them.

| Criterion | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Speed to market | 35% | Competitive window closing |
| Total cost | 25% | Budget constraints |
| Strategic control | 25% | Core capability |
| Risk | 15% | Execution complexity |

### 3. Evaluate Options
Score each option against criteria systematically.

| Criterion | Build | Acquire | Partner |
|-----------|-------|---------|---------|
| Speed to market | 2 | 4 | 5 |
| Total cost | 4 | 2 | 3 |
| Strategic control | 5 | 4 | 2 |
| Risk | 3 | 2 | 4 |
| **Weighted Score** | **3.3** | **3.1** | **3.5** |

### 4. Present the Recommendation
Lead with the answer, then the supporting logic.

"We recommend **partnering** because it offers:
- Fastest time to market (6 months vs. 18+ for build)
- Acceptable cost profile ($3M vs. $8M for acquisition)
- Manageable risk through structured agreement
- Option to acquire partner in 24 months"

### 5. Address Risks and Mitigations
Anticipate objections and show you've thought through them.

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Partner priorities shift | Medium | High | Contractual commitments + exec sponsorship |
| Integration challenges | Medium | Medium | Dedicated integration team |
| IP concerns | Low | High | Clear IP ownership in agreement |

## Recommendation Patterns

### The "No-Brainer"
One option clearly dominates on all criteria.

"Option A outperforms on every dimension. We recommend proceeding immediately."

### The "Trade-off"
Options excel on different dimensions.

"Option A offers lower risk but slower returns. Option B offers higher returns but greater complexity. Given our risk appetite and timeline, we recommend Option B with enhanced controls."

### The "Phased Approach"
Recommend a sequence rather than single option.

"We recommend a phased approach:
- Phase 1 (Q1-Q2): Pilot in two markets
- Phase 2 (Q3-Q4): Scale to remaining markets based on learnings
- Phase 3 (Year 2): Full rollout with optimized model"

### The "Conditional"
Recommendation depends on resolving key uncertainty.

"We recommend Option A **if** customer research validates willingness to pay. If not, we recommend pivoting to Option B."

## Quantifying Impact

### Always Include
- **Investment required**: What does it cost?
- **Expected return**: What do we get back?
- **Timeline**: When do we see results?
- **Confidence level**: How certain are we?

### Impact Statement Examples

"This initiative requires $2M investment over 18 months and is projected to generate $8M in incremental annual revenue (4x ROI) with 70% confidence."

"We estimate 15-20% cost reduction ($5-7M annually) achievable within 24 months, with payback in 14 months."

## Common Recommendation Mistakes

### Too Vague
❌ "We should improve our digital capabilities"
✅ "We should invest $3M in mobile checkout redesign, targeting 25% conversion improvement"

### Missing the "So What"
❌ "Analysis shows Option B scores highest"
✅ "Option B scores highest and should be pursued, generating $10M NPV over 5 years"

### Ignoring Trade-offs
❌ "Option A is clearly best"
✅ "Option A offers the best balance of speed and cost, though it requires accepting moderate integration risk"

### No Clear Next Steps
❌ "We recommend proceeding with the initiative"
✅ "We recommend Board approval this month, with kickoff in January and first milestone in March"

## The Recommendation Slide

### Essential Elements
1. **Headline**: Action-oriented recommendation
2. **The Ask**: What decision is needed
3. **Key Supporting Points**: 3-4 bullet maximum
4. **Financials**: Investment, return, timeline
5. **Next Steps**: Immediate actions required
