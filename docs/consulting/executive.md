# Executive Communication

## Understanding Executive Audiences

### What Executives Care About
- **Decisions**: What do I need to decide?
- **Impact**: What are the stakes?
- **Confidence**: How certain are we?
- **Timeline**: When do we need to act?
- **Resources**: What does it require?

### What Executives Don't Care About
- How you did the analysis
- All the options you considered
- Comprehensive background
- Caveats and disclaimers
- Technical methodology

## The Executive Summary

### Purpose
Allow executives to understand the full story in 60 seconds. Everything else is supporting detail.

### Structure
1. **Context** (1 sentence): Why are we here?
2. **Key Finding** (1-2 sentences): What did we learn?
3. **Recommendation** (1 sentence): What should we do?
4. **Impact** (1 sentence): What's the expected outcome?
5. **Ask** (1 sentence): What decision is needed?

### Example

> "Following the Board's request to evaluate growth options [context], our analysis identified Southeast Asia as a $500M opportunity where we have competitive advantage [finding]. We recommend entering through acquisition of LocalCo for $75M [recommendation], projecting $150M revenue contribution within 5 years [impact]. We seek approval to proceed with due diligence and LOI negotiation [ask]."

## Adapting to Different Executives

### The CEO
- Focus on strategic alignment
- Emphasize competitive implications
- Connect to company vision/priorities
- Be prepared for "why" questions

### The CFO
- Lead with financial impact
- Show clear ROI and payback
- Address risk quantitatively
- Have detailed numbers ready

### The COO
- Focus on execution feasibility
- Address operational implications
- Show realistic timelines
- Identify resource requirements

### The Board
- Highest-level strategic framing
- Governance and risk perspective
- Clear decision points
- Comparison to peer companies

## The "Elevator Pitch" Test

Can you explain your recommendation in 30 seconds?

### Formula
"We should **[action]** because **[key reason]**, which will **[outcome]**."

### Examples

"We should acquire TechCo because they have the only proven solution in the market, which will accelerate our cloud transition by 2 years."

"We should exit the consumer segment because it's structurally unprofitable, which will improve overall margins by 400 basis points."

"We should delay the product launch by one quarter because quality issues create liability risk, which protects our brand and avoids potential $50M exposure."

## Handling Questions

### The "So What" Question
Executive: "So what?"
Translation: "Why should I care? What does this mean for decisions?"

Response: Connect directly to business impact or decision at hand.

### The "How Confident Are You" Question
Executive: "How confident are you in this?"
Translation: "What are the risks? What could go wrong?"

Response: Be honest about confidence level, explain key assumptions, describe what would change the answer.

### The "What's the Alternative" Question
Executive: "What if we don't do this?"
Translation: "Is action really necessary? What's the cost of inaction?"

Response: Describe the status quo trajectory and its implications.

### The "What Do You Need From Me" Question
Executive: "What do you need from me?"
Translation: "What's the ask? What decision or resource are you seeking?"

Response: Be specific about the decision, approval, or resources required.

## Pre-Wiring and Alignment

### Before the Meeting
- Identify key stakeholders and their concerns
- Socialize findings with influential voices
- Address objections before they arise
- Secure sponsors for your recommendation

### The "No Surprises" Rule
Executives should never be surprised in a meeting. If your recommendation is controversial:

1. Meet individually with key stakeholders first
2. Understand and address their concerns
3. Adjust recommendation if needed
4. Enter meeting with aligned supporters

## Common Executive Communication Mistakes

### Leading with Process
❌ "We conducted 47 interviews and analyzed 3 years of data..."
✅ "Our analysis shows three clear opportunities..."

### Burying the Lead
❌ Building to a conclusion at the end
✅ Start with the recommendation, then support it

### Over-Qualifying
❌ "Depending on various factors and assumptions, we might potentially consider..."
✅ "We recommend X. Key assumptions are..."

### Reading Slides
❌ Narrating what's written on the slide
✅ Adding insight and context beyond what's visible

### Avoiding the Hard Message
❌ "There are some challenges we should discuss..."
✅ "We have a significant problem that requires immediate action..."
