# Headlines

## The Power of Action Headlines

Headlines are the most important text on any slide. They should communicate the key takeaway, not just label the content.

### Topic Labels vs. Action Headlines

❌ **Topic Label**: "Q3 Revenue Analysis"
✅ **Action Headline**: "Q3 revenue exceeded target by 12%, driven by enterprise segment growth"

❌ **Topic Label**: "Customer Satisfaction Results"
✅ **Action Headline**: "Customer satisfaction declined 8 points, requiring immediate intervention"

❌ **Topic Label**: "Competitive Landscape"
✅ **Action Headline**: "Three new entrants have captured 15% market share in 18 months"

## Headline Formulas

### The Insight Formula
**[What happened] + [Why it matters]**

- "Mobile traffic grew 40% but conversion dropped, signaling UX friction"
- "Customer acquisition cost doubled while LTV remained flat, threatening unit economics"
- "Three of five initiatives are off-track, putting Q4 targets at risk"

### The Recommendation Formula
**[Action verb] + [What] + [Expected outcome]**

- "Invest $2M in automation to reduce operating costs by 15%"
- "Expand into Southeast Asia to capture $50M revenue opportunity"
- "Consolidate three product lines to improve margins by 400bps"

### The Comparison Formula
**[Subject A] vs. [Subject B] + [Implication]**

- "We lag competitors on mobile experience, costing us younger demographics"
- "Premium tier outperforms standard 3:1 on retention, suggesting pricing power"
- "APAC growth outpaces EMEA 2x, warranting resource reallocation"

## Headline Tests

### The "So What" Test
Does the headline answer "so what?" or just describe content?

❌ "Overview of Market Segments" → So what?
✅ "Enterprise segment offers highest margins and fastest growth"

### The Standalone Test
Would an executive understand the key point from headlines alone?

Read only headlines in sequence. Does the story make sense?

### The Specificity Test
Does the headline include specific data or claims?

❌ "Sales improved significantly"
✅ "Sales grew 23% YoY, outpacing market by 8 points"

### The Action Test
Does the headline imply what should be done?

❌ "Customer churn analysis"
✅ "High churn in first 90 days requires improved onboarding"

## Headline Hierarchy

### Slide Title (Main Headline)
The key takeaway. Should work standalone.

"Digital transformation will reduce costs by 20% within 24 months"

### Section Headers
Organize supporting content. Lead into the evidence.

"Three initiatives drive the majority of savings"

### Chart Titles
Specific insight from the visualization.

"Cost per transaction declined 35% after automation rollout"

## Common Headline Mistakes

### Too Vague
❌ "Key Findings"
✅ "Analysis reveals three critical gaps in our go-to-market approach"

### Too Long
❌ "Our comprehensive analysis of the competitive landscape reveals that we are positioned third in market share but have opportunities to improve through focused investment in digital capabilities and customer experience"
✅ "We rank #3 in market share but can leapfrog through digital investment"

### Missing the Point
❌ "Revenue by Region" (describes chart)
✅ "APAC now contributes 40% of revenue, up from 25% three years ago"

### Burying the Lead
❌ "While there are several factors to consider, the data suggests..."
✅ "Data clearly supports Option B as the preferred path forward"

## Headline Writing Process

1. **Write the slide content first**
2. **Ask: What's the one thing I want them to remember?**
3. **Write that as a complete sentence**
4. **Add specifics (numbers, comparisons)**
5. **Cut to essential words**
6. **Test: Does it pass all four tests?**
