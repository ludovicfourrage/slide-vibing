# Narrative Structure

## The Situation-Complication-Resolution Framework

Every presentation should follow a clear narrative arc:

### Situation
Establish shared context. What does the audience already know and agree with?

- Current state of the business/market
- Relevant background information
- Shared assumptions and facts

**Example**: "Our e-commerce platform currently serves 2M monthly active users with 98.5% uptime."

### Complication
Introduce tension. What has changed? What problem needs solving?

- A challenge or threat
- An opportunity being missed
- A change in the environment

**Example**: "However, mobile conversion rates have dropped 23% over the past quarter while competitors have increased theirs by 15%."

### Resolution
Your recommendation. What should be done?

- Clear action steps
- Expected outcomes
- Resource requirements

**Example**: "We recommend a $2M investment in mobile UX redesign, projected to recover $8M in annual revenue within 18 months."

## Transition Techniques

### Between Sections
Use explicit transitions that preview what's coming:

- "Having established the market context, let's examine our competitive position."
- "This analysis points to three strategic options, which we'll evaluate next."
- "Before presenting our recommendation, let's review the key criteria."

### Building Arguments
Each slide should answer "so what?" and lead naturally to the next:

```
Slide 1: "Customer satisfaction has declined 15 points"
    ↓ So what?
Slide 2: "This correlates with $4M in lost renewals"
    ↓ So what?
Slide 3: "Root cause analysis points to response time issues"
    ↓ So what?
Slide 4: "Investing in support automation would address this"
```

## Common Anti-Patterns

### The Data Dump
❌ Presenting all data without synthesis
✅ Lead with insight, use data as evidence

### The Mystery Novel
❌ Building to a reveal at the end
✅ Lead with the conclusion, then support it

### The Laundry List
❌ Disconnected points without narrative thread
✅ Each point builds on the previous

### The False Start
❌ Extensive background before getting to the point
✅ Minimal context, maximum relevance
