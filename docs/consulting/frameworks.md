# Strategic Frameworks

## MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)

The foundation of structured thinking.

### Mutually Exclusive
No overlaps between categories. Each item belongs to exactly one bucket.

❌ Bad: "Customers, Enterprise Clients, Users" (overlapping)
✅ Good: "B2B Customers, B2C Customers" (no overlap)

### Collectively Exhaustive
All possibilities are covered. Nothing is left out.

❌ Bad: "North America, Europe" (missing regions)
✅ Good: "North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Rest of World" (complete)

### MECE Structures

**By Customer Segment**
- Enterprise (>1000 employees)
- Mid-Market (100-1000 employees)
- SMB (<100 employees)

**By Product Lifecycle**
- Acquisition
- Activation
- Retention
- Revenue
- Referral

**By Value Chain**
- Inbound Logistics
- Operations
- Outbound Logistics
- Marketing & Sales
- Service

**By Time Horizon**
- Immediate (0-3 months)
- Short-term (3-12 months)
- Medium-term (1-3 years)
- Long-term (3+ years)

## The Pyramid Principle

Structure arguments top-down: conclusion first, then supporting points.

### Core Rules

1. **Start with the answer** - Lead with your recommendation
2. **Group and summarize** - Similar ideas together under one theme
3. **Logical ordering** - Time, structure, or importance
4. **Support with evidence** - Each claim backed by data

### Pyramid Structure

```
                [Main Message]
                      |
        +-------------+-------------+
        |             |             |
   [Support 1]   [Support 2]   [Support 3]
        |             |             |
   +----+----+   +----+----+   +----+----+
   |    |    |   |    |    |   |    |    |
  [E1] [E2] [E3] [E4] [E5] [E6] [E7] [E8] [E9]
```

### Example

**Main Message**: "We should enter the Asian market through acquisition"

**Support 1**: "Market opportunity is significant"
- Asia-Pacific e-commerce growing 25% annually
- Our category underpenetrated vs. Western markets
- Rising middle class driving premium segment

**Support 2**: "Organic entry too slow given competitive dynamics"
- Three major competitors already established
- Brand building requires 3-5 years
- First-mover advantages accruing to incumbents

**Support 3**: "Acquisition targets available at reasonable valuations"
- Identified 4 potential targets
- Multiples 20-30% below Western peers
- Strategic rationale for sellers (access to our tech)

## Issue Trees

Break complex problems into answerable sub-questions.

### Structure

```
Key Question: "How can we increase profitability?"
    |
    +-- Revenue Growth
    |       +-- Price increases
    |       +-- Volume growth
    |       +-- Mix improvement
    |
    +-- Cost Reduction
            +-- COGS optimization
            +-- SG&A efficiency
            +-- Overhead reduction
```

### Building Issue Trees

1. **Start with the key question** - What decision needs to be made?
2. **Break into sub-questions** - MECE decomposition
3. **Continue until actionable** - Each branch should be testable
4. **Prioritize branches** - Focus on highest-impact areas

### Example: Market Entry

```
"Should we enter Market X?"
    |
    +-- Is the market attractive?
    |       +-- What is the market size and growth?
    |       +-- What are the margin structures?
    |       +-- What are the competitive dynamics?
    |
    +-- Can we win?
    |       +-- Do we have relevant capabilities?
    |       +-- What would differentiate us?
    |       +-- What are barriers to entry?
    |
    +-- Is it worth it?
            +-- What investment is required?
            +-- What is the expected return?
            +-- What are the risks?
```

## Porter's Five Forces

Assess industry attractiveness and competitive dynamics.

### The Five Forces

1. **Threat of New Entrants**
   - Capital requirements
   - Economies of scale
   - Brand loyalty
   - Regulatory barriers

2. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers**
   - Supplier concentration
   - Switching costs
   - Substitute inputs
   - Forward integration threat

3. **Bargaining Power of Buyers**
   - Buyer concentration
   - Price sensitivity
   - Switching costs
   - Backward integration threat

4. **Threat of Substitutes**
   - Substitute availability
   - Price-performance ratio
   - Switching costs
   - Buyer propensity to switch

5. **Competitive Rivalry**
   - Number of competitors
   - Industry growth rate
   - Fixed costs
   - Exit barriers

### Application

Rate each force: High / Medium / Low

| Force | Rating | Implication |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| New Entrants | Low | Protected position |
| Supplier Power | Medium | Monitor key suppliers |
| Buyer Power | High | Differentiation critical |
| Substitutes | Low | Core offering defensible |
| Rivalry | High | Compete on value, not price |
